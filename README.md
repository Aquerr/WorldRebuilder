## General

**WorldRebuilder** is *protection-like* plugin for SpongeForge. It is inspired by one of plugins for Bukkit.

**WorldRebuilder** allows you to **mark and create regions in the world which will be rebuilt after being destroyed**. 
That means, if anyone destroy something in such region by using a pickaxe, tnt, grenade or anything... all destroyed blocks will be restored in few seconds or minutes (depends on how you configure it).

**If you enjoy using World Rebuilder, give this repo a star!**

### Use Cases

This plugin is useful in situations when **you want to let players destroy terrain yet preserve your beautiful buildings.**

For example, you are making a **WWII style RPG map with guns and vehicles** and you would like to **let players destroy bunkers and other building** but you also **don't want to lose your epic creations** that you prepared in that map. In such situation you can use this plugin, mark regions which should be rebuilt and allow players destroy blocks.
