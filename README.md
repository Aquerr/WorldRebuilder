## General

**WorldRebuilder** is "protection-like" plugin for SpongeForge. It is inspired by one of plugins for Bukkit.

**What does it do?** WorldRebuilder allows you to **mark and create regions in the world which should be rebuilt after being destroyed**. 
That means, if anyone destroy something in that region by using a pickaxe, tnt, grenade or anything, all destroyed blocks will be restored in few seconds or minutes (depends on configuration). 

And that is what **WorldRebuilder** is all about. **It simply rebuilds blocks which have been destroyed.**

**If you enjoy using World Rebuilder, give this repo a star!**
